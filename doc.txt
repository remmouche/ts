Annotations:
Annotations are used to specify the data type of a variable, parameter, function return value, and other types of values.
Annotations help developers catch erros early in development by allowing them to specify what types of values can be assigned tp a given variables or passed or passed as an argument to a function. 

Type Inference
Type inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. In other words, if you declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type, TypeScript will try to infer the type based n the value you assign to it.
